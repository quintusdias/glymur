Changes in 0.13.2
*****************

    * Improve doctesting, fix broken libtiff doctest
    * Increase code coverage
    * Remove python 3.8 anachronisms
    * Fix repr for Jp2kr
    * Clean up ci directory
    * Change parsing of precinct sizes due to numpy 2.0,  It is now
      represented by a numpy array rather than a list of tuples.  This
      could be considered a minor incompatibility, but element-by-element
      access is still the same.
